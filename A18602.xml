            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Apology for the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Repentance, vnto faith <hi>in Chriſt.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Treatiſe called a Triall of Faith, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor intended to teach Chriſtians to examine rhemſelues, whether they had a ſauing Faith, or no. As meanes to that end, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the firſt booke certaine reaſons to perſwade vnto this Triall; and in the ſecond, ſome rules to direct them therein.</p>
            <p>Againſt the reaſons there is no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons taken (for ought I heare) but againſt the rules onely: nor yet againſt all: but onely the firſt, and the ſixt rule.</p>
            <p>That which hath been obiected againſt the firſt, hath beene fully anſwered in a briefe defence not long ſince publiſhed, and that which is excepted againſt, in the ſixt rule ſhall now, (God willing) be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſatiſfied, in a further confirmation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19912:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> thereof. In handling the ſixt Rule of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Faith, I did three things princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally.</p>
            <p>Firſt I proued generally, that there are ſome preparations wrought in men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can beleeue in Chriſt, whereby God drawes them thereunto. <hi>page</hi> 219, 220. (namely) that moſt vſually and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily it is ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and more ſpecially, I ſhewed what theſe preparations were, <hi>viz.</hi> Some gifts and abilities wrought by the ſpirit of God, in the vnderſtanding, and will, of thoſe whom the Lord hath a purpoſe to ſaue, <hi>page</hi> 220, to 224.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and in particular, I affirmed that a beginning of repentance is one of thoſe preparations, <hi>page</hi> 224, to 229.</p>
            <p>For making good of this third, and laſt point; I ſet downe this propoſition to be diſcuſſed. <hi>Repentance is begunne before faith in Chriſt.</hi> 1. <hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sinners beginne to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their ſinnes, and to purpoſe to leaue them, before they can beleeue in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> So, as to haue any beneſit thereby.</p>
            <p>Firſt I proued this point by arguments, ſecondly, I cleared it by anſwering ſome obiections, and laſtly, I applied it by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome further vſe thereof.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:19912:13"/>
            <p>Againſt theſe generall heads, and many particular members of each, there are (I vnderſtand) exceptions taken by ſome, and their exceptions (to omitte longer intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction) are either againſt the fixt rule it ſelfe, or the handling of that rule: not that they are propounded, in theſe very words and method: but that in ſubſtance and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they import as much and therefore are they by mee reduced, to theſe two heads, for my more orderly proceeding, and the Readers better vnderſtanding.</p>

               <head>The Exception, againſt the Triall.</head>
               <p>This Rule (ſay ſome in effect) is idle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pretends that men may try their faith by it: but indeede no man can, for (ſay they) all men are either regenerate, or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19912:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> vnregenerate, (there is no third conditio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> betwixt them, and different from them) and neither the one, nor the other, can try their faith by this rule.</p>
               <p>Not the regenerate becauſe there is no gift, power, quality, diſpoſition, habit, or affection (other then ſauing faith) that is or can be ſayd, to be a preparatiue to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Neither can vnregenerate me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> try their faith, becauſe there is no gift in men vnregenerate, whereby themſelues, or other can difference them, from thoſe that remaine in their naturall eſtate, and that ſhall periſh for euer.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Apology for the Triall.</head>
               <p>I anſwere, firſt generally to both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and vnregenerate, that though by their exception they ſeeme to giue two different Reaſons, one for the regenerate, and another for the vnregenerate: yet the reaſon belongs to all equally, becauſe it denies either to the one, or the other, all or any preparations before faith or rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, either to difference the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from the vnregenerate: or one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man from another for euer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwere to their reaſon concerning the Regenerate, that it is of no
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19912:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> force, why they may not try their faith by this Rule, becauſe it affirmes, that there can be no preparations at all to Regeneration but faith it ſelfe which cannot be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a beliefe of the Goſpell which is a ſtedfaſt aſſent to the trueth of that doctrine, is a gift of the Spirit, It is not a ſauing faith, but a<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> meanes to it: yet is this beliefe a preparatiue to regeneration, and therefore may a regenerate man try himſelfe by ſome other gift then by a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith, as by a preparation to Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and conſequently try his faith by this rule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I anſwere touching the vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, that their reaſon is vnſufficient, why they may not try their faith by this rule, becauſe though they haue not a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing faith (as indeed they haue not) yet may it not be in vaine for them to examine themſelues concerning a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uing faith by theſe preparations, for they may thinke they haue it, when indeed they haue not, and ſo may deceiue themſelues with a vaine preſumptuous hope of ſaluation. Now by this triall with theſe preparations they ſhall clearely diſcerne they haue it not: (for he that is farre from the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to faith muſt needes bee further of from faith it ſelfe: he that hath not the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19912:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> which is more common, hath not the greater which is more rare,) whereupon they may bee occaſioned, conſidering the danger of being without faith, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of hauing it, to ſeeke in the vſe of the meanes for it, and by ſeeking to finde and obtaine it.</p>
               <p>May not a man try whether hee haue a good leaſe or no, if he haue any leaſe at all though his leaſe be not good: yea, if hee haue any writing which hee takes to be a leaſe, though it be not, may hee not try whether he haue a good leaſe or no?</p>
               <p>Beſides though vnregenerate men haue no ſuch gift whereby they may bee diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, from ſuch as remaine in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall eſtate, and ſhall periſh for euer: ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> may they try whether they haue a ſauing faith or no: and by triall know they haue it not, becauſe they haue no ſuch gift; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all that haue faith haue ſuch a gift: euer as the want of election into a Colledge ſhewes that a man is not fellow there though he haue no gift whereby to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him from all that are fellowes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſchollers in that Colledge; for all that are fellowes or ſchollers of a Colledge are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected into it.</p>
               <p>If they had giuen ſome good reaſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> why there can be no preparations at all to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19912:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> faith in Chriſt, then had they ſpoken to purpoſe againſt my Rule; but ſeeing they haue not done it, therfore is the Rule good for the purpoſe to which I intended it, for all their exception.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, touching the proofe of their exception, viz: that there is no third ſtate or condition betwixt men regenerate and vnregenerate, I anſwere that they bring no proofe of it, therefore can I not allow of it; and beſides the contrary ſeemes to me very probable, vnderſtanding this to be their meaning (as it muſt be if it be to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) that there is no third condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a meere naturall man and one fully regenerate: for I thinke a third condition ſomewhat different from both, may bee aſſigned: and giuen namely, the condition of preparation, which may be compared to the twy-light, that is betwixt cleare day, and darke night, wherein whoſoeuer is (being elected) may be ſaid to be in his paſſage from the one, which is meere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the other which is perfect regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and betweene both: that is, ſome way forwarded vnto regeneration, and about to enter into Gods Kingdome, and yet not actually admitted thereunto, as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, not borne, or in the birth, not quite
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19912:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> brought forth, for as we read of ſome that were entred into Gods Kingdome and <hi>were</hi>

                  <hi>were entring in, or about to enter,</hi> but not quite in.</p>
               <p>I know there are but two places to bee enioyed by men after this life, Heauen and Hell, and but two ſorts of perſons to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit them, Elect and Reprobate: yet may the Elect, before they come into Heauen, be ſaid to paſſe through a threefold condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the firſt of meere nature, in which there are no workes of the Spirit toward Regeneration. The ſecond of Preparation, wherein there bee ſome gifts of the Spirit beſtowed on them to diſpoſe them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. And the third is the full worke of Regeneration it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And I can ſee no reaſon in the world why this ſhould be counted a Paradox or ſtrange poſition, ſeeing (ordinarily) all they that are of age, paſſe through this preparation,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note>

               <p>Their firſt reaſon<note place="margin">To the firſt reaſon.</note> is of no force: Firſt becauſe though thoſe preparations, do not in the euent draw all men to beleeue in Chriſt, in whom they are wrought: yet do they at one time or other, draw all the elect ſo to do, that are ordained vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and to beleeue in him for that end. For of theſe onely is the queſtion. Secondly, if their reaſon were good, then would it proue that a beleefe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, is none of Gods cords, to draw men to beleeue in Chriſt, nor the Preaching of the Goſpell none of Gods meanes, to worke faith in Chriſt, for neither the one does draw al men ſo to come to Chriſt, nor the other ſo worke faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in all that haue the one wrought in them, or the other taught vnto them: witneſſe the Parable of the ſeede in the Goſpell.<note place="margin">Mat. 11.19. to 28.</note> Is not the act of generation Gods ordinance to the begetting of a child, becauſe a child is not begotten by euery hand acts.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe Gods ſpirit doth not onely draw men to beleeue in Chriſt: but alſo workes it in them actually, at one time or other, after thoſe preparations: but draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to beleeue, or preparing them thereunto, is a different action, from his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19912:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> working of faith, or enabling them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and in the elect comming followes drawing neceſſarily, in reſpect of the euent.</p>
               <p>Their ſecond reaſon<note place="margin">To the ſecond reaſon.</note> whereby they would prooue, that ſome of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I name, cannot goe before faith in Chriſt, is of no power: becauſe, though I ſay ſome of them may go before it in one reſpect; yet may they follow in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Indeede I ſay, that a feare of God, goes before faith in Chriſt, as a preparation to it, <hi>page</hi> 222. and that a feare of God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes faith in Chriſt, as an effect thereof: <hi>page</hi> 304. but neither doe I ſay, that a fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all feare is the preparation, nor a ſeruile feare the effect: though the faithfull after beleeuing in Chriſt, doe feare to ſinne for feare of condemnation, elſe the Holy Ghoſt would neuer diſwade from it on that ground.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſayde of ſorrow for ſinne, by comparing <hi>page</hi> 222. where it is a preparation to faith, and <hi>page</hi> 301. where it is an effect of a ſauing faith, (or rather of one that hath it) for I do not ſay, that ſorrow for ſinne on the ſame grounds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and in the ſame meaſure doth goe before and after faith in Chriſt, and

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:19912:22"/> to expreſſe the Precedency I meane, but neither did I meane, a precedency ſome ſpace of time, nor can they ſhew it by the words of the booke, except I had added thereunto ſome other word as <hi>time, ſpace, ſeaſon,</hi> or the like, to giue light to ſuch an interpretation, which is not done in that whole diſputation. Or except the word <hi>Before</hi> in the Engliſh tongue, did alwayes carry that ſence onely, which experience diſprooues; ſeeing one thing may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another in nature, as fire before heat; in order, as the ſecond before the third; In dignity as an Earle before a Baron; and in worth, as gold before ſiluer: As well as in time, as the begetting of a childe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his birth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they had reaſon to interpret my meaning of a precedency in nature, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in time, becauſe I made the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of repentance to be a meanes vnto Faith in Chriſt (as is to bee ſeene by my two firſt Arguments and other places of the booke) and therefore before it onely in the order of cauſes, and conſequently in the order of nature. 2. Becauſe in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, I oppoſe the common opinion, and the receiued opinion concerning the precedency betwixt Repentance and Faith, is, that faith goes before repentance
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19912:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> not in time, but in nature, therefore my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that contradicts theirs, ſhould be vnderſtood of the ſame manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency <hi>viz.</hi> that repentance goes before faith in order of Nature.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though I meant a precedency in nature, yet did I not meane that ſo much, as the proofe of this, namely a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the being of repentance with faith in Chriſt. For my chiefe intent was to ſhew that ſinners cannot, warrantably with any expectation of benefit by thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when I ſay ſinners may not beleeue in Chriſt before they haue repented: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be neceſſarily concluded, I meant, they muſt repent ſome ſpace of time before they beleeue in Chriſt. They may with as good reaſon vnderſtand, they muſt doe both at one time, when they beleeue in Chriſt they muſt repent, and if they ſo doe, it will be well pleaſing to God: Charity might haue taught them to interprete mee the beſt way rather then the worſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they that hold repentance and faith goe together in time, (but giue the precedency to faith in nature) yet ſpeake of the precedency of faith vnto repentance, and when they ſpeake of this precedency they ſay faith goes before repentance: and why then may not I which hold, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith goe together in time, but giue the precedency to repentance in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſpeake of this precedency, and ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance goes before faith, why ſhould I be vnderſtood of predecency ſome ſpace of time, more then they, and be blamed therefore rather then they.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, (if I may freely ſpeake my
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19912:24"/> minde) I thinke it may be maintained, that in ſome caſes, and in ſome perſons, in theſe dayes, repentance in ſome degree may be wrought before faith in Chriſt ſome ſpace of time, according as thoſe doctrines may be preached firſt or laſt in time, and be made effectuall to the good of the hearers by Preaching; for I could neuer yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how it croſt any commandement or promiſe of God, or hindered any duty or comfort of the faithfull, or diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſincerity of profeſſion, or diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the perſeuerance of the Elect, in the eſtate of grace, or derogated from the free grace of God in Chriſt, or lifted vp man in any proud conceit of his owne free will, as long as it is affirmed, that repentance is but begunne onely: that it is wrought by the Spirit onely, and by the word onely, and in the Elect onely, and onely as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their Election, and only as a meanes to worke Gods will on them, by diſpoſing them to faith in Chriſt, whereby they may be brought to that ſupernaturall end, to which they are ordained in him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there needed no ſuch clamour, as hath beene noyſed about it, ſuppoſing the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath beene ſo vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>But (it may be) others ſee what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, they diſcerne more vntruth in the

               <p>Secondly, the conſequence is naught, becauſe it prooues no more but that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not begunne till faith in Chriſt, and not that it is nor begun in time before it: for betwixt theſe two propoſitions there is great difference as hath bin wel obſerued by them in their anſwer to my 3 argument.</p>
               <p>The Aſſumption likewiſe is not true, 1. becauſe a man may beginne to returne by illumination, for that is <hi>a turning of men from darkeneſſe to light,</hi> except they neede not repent of their ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity. 2.<note place="margin">Acts. 26 18.</note> becauſe a man may begin to returne by a beleefe of that word that threatens the impenitent and for feare of puniſhment, he may alſo proceede further herein, by a beleefe of that word which promiſeth mercy to the repentant, and in hope of pardon, but a man muſt beginne to returne before he beleeue that God will be mercifull to him in ſpeciall, or elſe hee will neuer begin to returne, becauſe there is no ſuch ſpeciall promiſe in the word, to be beleeued, as may appeare by this reaſon.</p>
               <p>The beleefe that God will be mercifull to a man in ſpeciall, muſt be either abſolute
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19912:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> or conditionall. Abſolute it cannot be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man can beleeue in this manner abſolutely, but he to whom ſuch mercy is abſolutely promiſed. Now in the word there is mercy promiſed to none but vnder the condition of repentance and faith in Chriſt, nor is this mercy promiſed in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and particular, but in generall to all mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> which beleeue in Chriſt.</p>

               <p>So that in <hi>Muſculus</hi> opinion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19912:59"/> in nature goes before acceſſe to the throne of grace, and before our being capable of grace, (and conſequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith, by which onely wee haue this liberty,) <hi>viz:</hi> becauſe Repentance was the firſt Doctrine which they preached to their hearers.</p>
               <p>Secondly and more ſpecially in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Antecedent, I ſay, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, for the confutation of my Antecedent, they bring two Reaſons I will anſwere to them ſeuerally.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God doeth not alwayes call for faith in Chriſt firſt, for in that place firſt he preached <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſme of Repentance, ver. 37. and of the day of Iudgement, v. 42. which (comparing, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24. with <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30.31.) require repentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though faith were included in the Doctrine of repentance; yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of it in that Doctrine, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. No more prooues the precedency in nature of faith in Chriſt vnto Repentance, (which is their opinion,) then the precedency of Repentance vnto Faith, which is mine.</p>
               <p>To the conſequence I anſwere firſt, that (notwithſtanding their Reaſons) it is very probable, if we conſider theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, was effectuall to ſome of their hearers.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:19912:60"/>
               <p>Secondly, that this efficacy of their preaching conſiſted in working (through Gods bleſſings) in their hearers, an ability to doe the duties they taught, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they did exhort.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that this ability of doing thoſe duties, was wrought in them as the Doctrines were taught, or when they were preached (as appeares plainely in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles for the reſt.) <hi>Acts</hi> 14.1.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. So that if Repentance were the firſt duty which all theſe taught, teaching were the meanes whereby they were inabled to doe it, and this ability were giuen to them, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And they might as conueniently be wrought in their hearers for that end, according to the order in which they are taught, as any othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly I anſwere to the conſequence, for as much as it is euident; that neither <hi>Iohn,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Their reaſons likewiſe brought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow my conſequence are inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               <p>The firſt becauſe, though it be granted, that when God calleth for any one grace, none of the reſt are excluded; but inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded rather: yet will not this prooue, that in nature repentance goes before faith, but onely that they both goe together in time, and that both at one time, they are wroght together. Now for all this circumſtance, the worke of Repentance may in nature goe before faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, becauſe though that which is firſt placed, bee not the firſt wroght, in as much as that which is firſt in words, may be laſt in ſenſe: yet for all this, may repentance be firſt wrought, ſeeing it is firſt taught, becauſe GOD vſually wrought graces as they were taught, as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19912:61"/> hath beene ſhewed out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> but euen now; and therefore repentance may bee firſt both in ſenſe as well as in wordes, becauſe it is firſt in nature as well as in words.</p>
               <p>If they had giuen any reaſon why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance could not bee firſt in ſenſe or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture though it were ſo in words, then had they indeed weakened my Argument, but till then it is good enough.</p>

               <p>I anſwere firſt, if they could proue this to be the reaſon of their preaching it firſt, I would diſcard my Argument, and the probability it ſeemes to haue, 2. I would faine know a reaſon why the duty of faith which is beleeuing in Chriſt (of which the queſtion is) ſhould not be as ſoone felt as the duty of repenting, if the one be as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought as the other?</p>
               <p>Indeed the duties of repentance, which are hearty ſorrowe for paſt ſinnes, and purpoſe vnfained to leaue them, are ſooner felt then the comfort of faith, which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance and perſwaſion of ſaluation by Chriſt: but I can ſee no reaſon why the one habit or vertue, ſhould not be aſſoone

               <p>But they vrge in their anſwere to this Argument, that in my proofe hereof, I contradict ſomething deliuered elſe where: for firſt, in one place, I ſay, that repentance is the firſt grace that is wrought in men by preaching of the Goſpell, pag: 261. and in another place I ſay that other graces goe before rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there I ſpeake of the practiſe of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance aſſoone as it is wrought; but in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, I ſay that practiſe of repentance fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes faith in Chriſt.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Apology.</head>
               <p>To the firſt I anſwere that I doe not ſay ſimply, pa: 262. that repentance goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all grace, for I neuer meant it went before a beliefe of the Goſpell, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is euident by the ſtate of the queſtion, pag: 231. but onely that it goes before faith in Chriſt: of the two, that is, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith, Repentance is the firſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all thoſe graces that are ſaide elſe where to goe before Repentance; doe but prepare to it, &amp; ſo after a ſort, may be ſaid to make vp but that grace of Repentance.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:19912:62"/>
               <p>To the ſecond ſuppoſed contradiction, I anſwere, that the imputation is vniuſt, for where p. 261. l. 21. I ſpeake of the practiſe of repentance as ſoone as it is wrought; I onely meant the duty of repentance, in the heart or the act of repenting, as it is, in the ſoule, <hi>viz:</hi> actuall ſorrowing for paſt ſinnes, and reſoluing to leaue them: and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place, pag. 231. 21. 22. I ſpeake of the practiſe of repentance in the life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation: that is, of the effects and fruites of it, when the inward purpoſe of the heart to leaue ſinne, is brought vnto an outward act and execution: and therefore betwixt theſe (no more then betwixt the other two) is there any contradiction, as is pretended either to the truth of Gods word, or of mine owne opinion: and this is ſufficient to haue ſaide in defence of my ſix Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, againſt that which by ſome hath beene obiected againſt my opinion.</p>
               <p>The Arguments I haue already brought to prooue my opinion, being defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the exceptions of ſome. It remaines that as yet they ſtand for good: ſo that the maine queſtion needes no more confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Notwithſtanding it will not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe by way of aduantage to adde one more to the former, to driue the nayle to the head.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:19912:62"/>
               <p>If repentance goe in nature before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, then it goes in nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But repentance goes in nature before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Therefore repentance goes in nature before faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of the propoſition, (<hi>viz:</hi> repentance goes before faith, becauſe it goes before pardon) I proue thus.</p>
               <p>If repentance goe before remiſſion of ſinnes, and not before faith in Chriſt, then either it muſt goe hand in hand with iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith; or come betweene iuſtifying faith, and iuſtification it ſelfe; neither of which are true.</p>
               <p>Firſt repentance doth not goe hand in hand with iuſtifying faith: firſt, becauſe then it ſhould haue as great a hand in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinne, as faith in Chriſt; or we muſt determine what part it hath in remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: ſecondly, they cannot anſwere ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſay repentance is a fruit of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification which followes iuſtification, and therefore repentance cannot come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iuſtification with iuſtifying faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, repentance doeth not come betweene iuſtifying faith, and iuſtification it ſelfe; for the one followes ſo immed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19912:63"/> for no ſooner can a ſinner beleeue in Chriſt, but immediatly he hath remiſſion of his ſinnes and is iuſtified.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption (<hi>viz:</hi> Repentance goes before remiſſion of ſinnes) I prooue by teſtimony of Scripture.</p>
               <p>The teſtimonies of Scripture are theſe, <hi>Deut:</hi> 30.2. <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.8. &amp; 4.4. &amp; 26.3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18 21. <hi>Zech,</hi> 1.3. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. &amp; 3.19. &amp; 26.18. 1. <hi>Ioa.</hi> 1.7.9. whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I thus reaſon.</p>
               <p>That which is required as a condition to be performed before wee obtaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is before it in nature.</p>
               <p>Repentance in all thoſe is required of ſinners as a condition to be performed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they obtaine pardon.</p>
               <p>Therfore repentance is before remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins: for it cannot be denied but that howſoeuer the end (as apprehended poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be had) may ſtirre vp a man to vſe the meanes which be in order to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thereof: yet the meanes muſt needes in nature be before the actuall obtaining of the end; neither can it bee denied but that Gods Spirit in the place afore named, directs vs vnto repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance as a means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining forgiuenes, by the apprehenſion of it, appointing vs to vſe the means to get it.

               <p>To prooue the firſt concerning that Text to the <hi>Galathians</hi> they bring this reaſon. The life ſpoken of, <hi>Gallat.</hi> 2.20. is life by ſaluation, therefore by iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and fanctification, therefore euery way.</p>

               <p>I anſwere, firſt if by regeneration be meant our being made Gods children actually, then I grant, that our regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt needes flow from our vnion with him by faith, but then it prooues not the Antecedent, for the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wee ſpeake of is not our beeing actually made the ſonnes of GOD, but a worke of the Spirit beginning

               <p>It is true that Regeneration iſſues from Chriſt, in the elect whether wee conſider him as the efficient cauſe, either by way of meriting it for vs, or by working it in vs. <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 12.3. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Epheſians</hi> 1.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.10. or as the finall cauſe, <hi>Galath.</hi> 4.19.

               <p>I anſwere: 1. If by loue be meant
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19912:91"/> any kinde of loue to God, then I grant the conſequence and deny the aſſumption. But if thereby bee meant that loue of God which proceedeth from our actuall being beloued of God in Chriſt, and our apprehending of the ſame in our owne perticular iuſtification, then I deny the conſequence and grant the aſſumption. Some loue of God may be before iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, for God is the obiect of loue, and God may bee conceiued and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as louing, not onely in many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings, but euen in ſome ſpiritual, before men beleeue in Chriſt.

                  </gap> from God, I ſay ſuch loue is true in it kind, as being anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that, which God aimes at, in ſuch
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19912:91"/> meanes, though not with that perfection which is requiſite to ſaluation immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet with that which is requiſite by way of diſpoſition and preparatorily. But that loue of God which proceedeth from the receiuing and apprehenſion of our iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a fruit of faith in Chriſt, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes it. 2. I anſwer, that if by repentance be meant the practiſe of amendment of life, and new obedience, then the loue of God goes before repentance: but if by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be meant hearty ſorrow for ſinne paſt, and true purpoſe to leaue it, then I ſay the loue of God doth not go before repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Touching the firſt part of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umption, out of the <hi>Galathians</hi> that faith goes before loue, I ſay, it is not to purpoſe becauſe it proues not that faith goes before all loue, but only that loue which proceeds from our firſt beeing beloued of God, which we apprehend by faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Neither is the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> out of the Homilies rightly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged to proue the 2 part of their aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> that repentance hath an ingredient charity, &amp; that repentance is a fruite of the loue of God: for the repentance the Homily ſpeakes of is not repentance ſtrictly taken <hi>viz.</hi> ſorrow for ſinne and purpoſe of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it of which I ſpeake, but the whole
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19912:92"/> worke of Gods Spirit on man to make him capable of iuſtification and ſalvation, or the whole conuerſion of man in minde and will, in affections and actions, inward and outward; and this appeares in that it makes foure parts of repentance there ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Sorrow for ſinne, 2. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and confeſſion of it, 3. faith in Chriſt, and 4. amendment of life: in which ſenſe it is no maruell if hee include loue and charity in repentance: ſoe that there is no reaſon to conclude thence that loue is included in repentance ſtrictly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (as I do,) except they meane by loue ſome affection to God for making it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs to bee ſaued and prouiding a meanes to that end, and not a loue of God for our being actually ſaued, or meane by repentance amendment of life: for this is a fruite of loue, and in this ſence it is that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeakes to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many do daily ſay, they are ſinners, and yet ſtill they delight to ſinne, this is but profeſſion, not amendment, the ſoule is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, not healed, the offence is pronounced, not taken away,</hi>

                  <hi>nothing makes true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance but the hatred of ſinne, and loue of God the fire of this ſacrifice is loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now at length I draw homeward, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a concluſion of the whole, namely,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19912:92"/> to the laſt thing propounded in handling this point, of the precedency of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance vnto faith in Chriſt, which is the vſe and application, I made thereof in my Treatiſe, with which, as with the reſt there is fault found.</p>
               <p>It will not be worth my labour to confute (muchleſſe recite) the particular faults and aberations, they eſpie therein:<note place="margin">The applying of the point.</note> becauſe the anſwere vnto them, will little ſerue to the cleering of the Doctrine it ſelfe: partly becauſe that which I ſhould write in confutation thereof, muſt be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of that I haue already ſayd in this Defence, and partly alſo becauſe the whole frame of thoſe exceptions, will of it ſelfe (vpon my Defence) fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>For I thinke they would neuer haue written againſt the application; but vpon a ſuppoſition, that the point whereupon it was rayſed, is vnſound: for the vſe of a Doctrine is good or bad, according as the nature of the Doctrine is true or falſe, as wel as if it be proper &amp; natural, or ſtreined and impertinent.</p>
               <p>Now then if it may appeare as I (hope it ſhall to all that are willing and able to iudge) that I haue anſwered all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, then doth my Doctrine touching
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19912:93"/> the precedency of repentance vnto Faith in Chriſt as yet ſtand vpright, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the application thereof by way of confutation, inſtruction, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, exhortation, and conſolation, muſt goe for currant being naturall to the point and not wreſted.</p>
               <p>As it will not bee needefull for mee to defend all thoſe vſes, ſo neither to inlarge them, onely I would adde out more to the other fiue, and cleere one of them which I haue already made.</p>
               <p>That which I would adde to the other ſhould bee by way of caution, which is to aduertiſe the Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that in peruſing this my Defence, and meditating on the point it ſelfe, he would not doe either the one or the other, with a minde onely intent to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truth of the point, but with a heart to bee affected with the truth, when it is vnderſtood: not labouring ſo much, to enquire whether of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Faith, the one or the other goes before in nature or in time, as whether they haue them both or no, and how they may get them both, both being neceſſary in their kinde vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:19912:93"/>
               <p>That vſe which I would cleare, ſhould be the fourth. (whence as alſo from other places in the Treatiſe, <hi>viz. page</hi> 226. 233, 234.) ſome collect, that I make that faith, not to be ſauing faith, which is not wrought after Repentance.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere, far be it from me to imagine, muſt leſſe to determine, that a true faith in Chriſt, (ſuppoſing it to be true) cannot be a ſauing Faith. For Faith in CHRIST is a true ſauing Faith, let it bee wrought by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD when it will, before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repentance: for I thinke the hand of the Lord, is not to bee tyed, in as much as hee may worke how, and when hee will, with, and by the vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes, and ordinarily, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, or againſt them, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily.</p>
               <p>But this I ſay, that for as much as it hath appeared, that vſually, and in the common order of Gods working, generally and in his ordinary courſe, God prepares men to beleeue in Chriſt, by the fore-worke of ſome graces tending to it, and that many will preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſay and perſwade they beleeue in Chriſt, when indeede they doe not: and therefore to reſtraine men from
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19912:94"/> preſumption, I ſay that ſuch perſons, <hi>may not perſwade themſelues, as yet they hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And that this is ſo, may appeare becauſe in that vſe I ſpeake onely of carnall Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers, who cannot haue a ſauing faith indeede, yet may they preſume they haue it.</p>
               <p>May not a Miniſter of the Goſpell, knowing that Preaching is the way and meanes to worke faith in Chriſt (<hi>viz.</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) reprooue carnall Goſpellers, that neglect and contemne hearing of Sermons and yet thinke they haue faith in Chriſt: may they not ſay that their faith us not a ſauing faith, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they ſubmit no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> themſelues to the ordinary meanes which ſhould beget it, may not they ſay ſafely and truely that their faith is not a ſauing faith, though God can, and will, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time doth worke a ſauing faith without theſe meanes, <hi>viz.</hi> extraordinarily? why then may not I ſay, that the faith of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Goſpellers is not true ſauing faith, ſeeing they were neuer prepared to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb facs="tcp:19912:94"/> in Chriſt by the diſpoſitions, which Gods holy Spirit workes ordinarily in thoſe in whom he begets a ſauing ſaith, though ſometime God can and will, in an enthuſiaſme, and ſodaine rapture, worke a ſauing faith, without theſe preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Surely yea, for not Gods extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wayes and workes but his ordinary, are the pathes wherein wee muſt walke, the rule by which we muſt proceede, and the Touch by which wee muſt try our ſelues in caſes of this nature.

               <p>By that which is written in this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, the Chriſtian Reader may diſcerne the materiall Exceptions againſt my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the Defence of my Doctrine againſt thoſe Exceptions.</p>
               <p>I know full well that a Maiſter of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence would haue put by theſe thruſts, with more skill, or haue beaten them backe with more ſtrength, but I am onely a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in this Schoole, and therefore onely as a Scholler in this faculty <hi>(pro meo marte &amp; arte)</hi> I haue playd my prize.</p>
               <p>That which by Gods prouidence I haue ſeene materially obiected againſt my Doctrine, I haue (with Gods grace) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, the pertinency and ſufficiency of which anſwere I referre to the more

Though the Lord hath actually willed and appointed that faith in Chriſt ſhall be the meanes to make vs capable of eternall life (that is, inſtrumentally onely and in no ſenſe meritoriouſly) yet God as ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord of all, can now appoint ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes to make vs capable thereof, as he would ſtraine his wit to interpreat me. But my meaning is (which is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the context) that before the Lord appointed and willed that faith in Chriſt ſhould be that meanes, by his abſolute power, as ſoueraigne Lord of all, hee might haue appointed any other grace, to haue beene the meanes (inſtrumental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conditionally) to haue made vs capable of Heauen. If God by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power can do more then either he doth or will, (as is confeſt out of Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>) then in caſe God had not willed that Faith in Chriſt ſhould be this meanes, he might by his abſolute power, haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed any other meanes, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what meanes he would to make vs cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of life. For that action which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
<pb facs="tcp:19912:97"/> vpon Gods free will or ordination, that, by his abſolute power, he could haue done otherwiſe, (for that is the nature of free-will to do ſo as that they might haue done otherwiſe:) but the appointing of the meanes to make vs capable of ſaluation depends vpon Gods free-will and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore he might haue done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and conſequently by his abſolute power, he could haue appointed what meanes he would, to make vs capable of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>And that the appointing of the meanes to make vs capable of ſaluation, depends on the free-will and ordination of God appeares becauſe the merits of Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The third hereticall blaſphemous poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:19912:98"/> is this that I ſay, <hi>the act of faith, which is beleeuing in Chriſt doth iuſtifie vs, and is our righteouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this ſentence I wil not ſay much here, becauſe I haue maintained it to be ſound Doctrine (in my ſenſe) in a priuate writing to himſelfe, which he promiſed to anſwere, but yet hath not performed it, as alſo in a publike defence in print, and in the view of the world, which was peruſed and alſo allowed by two very learned and godly Doctors of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for that end (which I humbly pray the Reader to peruſe for his ſatiſfaction, if hee be doubtfull,) euen as this Apology alſo hath beene prooued and approued by the ſame worthy Diuines. And ſo I paſſe from the hereſie and blaſphemy with which he charges me, to the periury, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and contradiction, which is inſtanced by two particulars.</p>
               <p>The firſt inſtance to prooue the periury lying, and contradiction is this, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in my ſecond Booke, <hi>I proteſt I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wrote, that Chriſt hath merited that faith ſhould be our righteouſneſſe, and iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vs,</hi> Defence, pag. 35. and yet in my firſt booke I ſay, <hi>the act of faith iuſtifies vs for the merit of Chriſt.</hi> Triall, page 196.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, in theſe two ſentences I doe

               <p>But it may be the propoſitions in the ſeuerall bookes are the ſame in ſenſe and effect, therefore if in one place I deny, that Chriſt hath merited that faith ſhould iuſtifie vs, and in another place affirme as much in effect, then haue I contradicted, and conſequently periured and lied,</p>
               <p>I anſwere, I haue not in effect contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted my ſelfe, firſt becauſe iuſtification in the firſt ſentence is taken for our being iuſtified formally, or for the nature and being thereof, and for that very thing,

               <p>Secondly, I anſwere: In the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition my meaning is, I neuer wrote; that the merit of Chriſt is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to faith, and that by communion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in faith iuſtifies vs, (as the Papiſts ſpeake of the merits of our workes, when they are dipt or died in Chriſts blood:) For then ſhould faith either deſerue, or be the iuſtice whereby of ſinners wee are made righteous, both which are farre, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uer were from my thoght (the Lord knowes.) And in the ſecond ſentence my meaning is, the merits of Chriſt come betweene our faith and iuſtification, not to giue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue vnto faith to iuſtifie vs: but to leade vs vnto Chriſt by whoſe merit we may receiue that righteouſneſſe, whereby of ſinners we are made iuſt;<note place="margin">Triall pag. 199.</note> and in this ſenſe I ſay, in my firſt Booke, that faith iuſtifies vs rather then any other grace of God,
<pb facs="tcp:19912:100"/> namely becauſe it makes vs goe out of our ſelues, to ſeeke to the all ſufficiency, of the death and obedience of Chriſt, to reſt and truſt in him for iuſtification and ſaluation,<note place="margin">Ser. of ſaluation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

So that our faith in Chriſt (as it were) ſaith vnto vs thus. It is not I that take away your ſinnes, but it is Chriſt onely, and to him onely I ſend you for that purpoſe, forſaking therein all your good vertues, thoughts and workes, and onely put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your truſt in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond inſtance by which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes to argue me of periury, lying, and contradiction, is, in my ſecond Book, <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt I neuer wrote in my firſt Booke, that faith is our righteouſneſſe,</hi> and yet in my firſt Booke I ſay, <hi>faith is our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere, that this doth not argue me of periury, lying, and contradiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I doe not ſpeake of faith being our righteouſneſſe in the ſame ſenſe and reſpect in both, for in the firſt ſentence righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt be taken properly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally for that very iuſtice, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:19912:100"/> men are made iuſt and righteous, as by a forme, and of ſinners made righteous formally. And in the ſecond ſentence, righteouſneſſe is taken improperly for an attribute giuen to faith, and it is the ſame with obedience, which the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> attributes to faith. <hi>Romans</hi> 16.26. (For beleeuing in Chriſt is obedience to that commandement of God, which bids vs beleeue in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.23. and not beleeuing in Chriſt, is diſobedience <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.36.) and in this ſenſe it is true, faith is our righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.11.</note> when it is wrought in vs, as well, as faith is ours, when it is wrought in vs. And when I ſay, faith is our righteouſneſſe, I doe not meane it is the righteouſneſſe, by which wee ſtand truely and formally righteous before GOD, and in which wee ſhall bee preſented pure, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpotte of ſinne before Him, but in this ſenſe, that it is all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and all the obedience, which GOD workes in vs and requires of vs, as an inſtrument apprehending, to make vs capable of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. According to the Doctrine of our Church, <hi>Paul declareth here, (Rom.</hi> 3.25.<note place="margin">Ser. of ſaluation part <hi>1</hi> toward the end.</note>) <hi>nothing on the behalfe of man but onely a true and liuely faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19912:101"/>
               <p>Not that the act of faith is our formall righteouſneſſe, and iuſtifies vs meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for, or by any worthineſſe inherent in it ſelfe, or infuſed thereunto by Chriſts merits, but that it is called righteouſneſſe in a borrowed ſenſe, becauſe it is only the inſtrument appointed by God, whereby we are to apprehend, and lay hold vpon Chriſts merits which are our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the onely meritorious cauſe of our iuſtification.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond accuſation he doth argue me onely of lying and contradiction, which he indeauours to do by this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in my ſecond booke, I ſay, <hi>my firſt Booke was not a Treatiſe of iuſtification,</hi> and yet in the Title of my ſecond Booke I name my firſt Booke a <hi>Triall of Faith concerning iuſtification by faith,</hi> but this doth not argue me of lying and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which I thus declare. 1. becauſe I do not entitle my firſt Booke a Triall of the Doctrine of iuſtification: but a Triall of Faith. 2. Foraſmuch as faith is taken in Scripture in one ſenſe, wherein we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it not to iuſtifie, and in another wherein we conceiue it doth iuſtifie. To the end I might fully declare, that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was in my Booke to ſpeake of the latter, not of the former, I added in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb facs="tcp:19912:101"/> of the ſecond Booke theſe words, <hi>viz. concerning the Doctrine of iuſtification in Faith:</hi> So that the ſentence, wherein hee ſuppoſeth the contradiction to bee hath this ſenſe, the Triall of faith, <hi>viz.</hi> of that faith which concernes iuſtification by faith.</p>
               <p>And that the latter words, <hi>viz. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Doctrine of iuſtification by faith,</hi> do argue, that by Faith I meant iuſtifying faith, this Argument will ſhew.</p>
               <p>That Faith which concernes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of iuſtification by faith, is iuſtifying Faith, for no faith doth concerne that Doctrine but iuſtifying faith.</p>
               <p>But the Faith whereof I wrote, doth concerne the Doctrine of iuſtification by faith, ſo ſaith the title of the ſecond booke. Therefore the faith whereof I ſpeake is a iuſtifying Faith.</p>
               <p>If hee would argue me of lying and contradiction herein, it muſt be by ſuch an Argument as this.</p>
               <p>That booke which concernes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of iuſtification by faith is a Treatiſe of iuſtification.</p>
               <p>But my firſt booke concernes the Doctrine of iuſtification by faith, ſo faith my ſecond Booke in the Title.</p>
               <p>Therefore my firſt Booke is a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
<pb facs="tcp:19912:102"/> of iuſtification.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere, iuſtification may be conſidered, either as it is explicated and treated of, by all the cauſes thereof, and all the arguments incident thereunto, or as it is conſidered onely in one cauſe concurring thereunto.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſenſe, I grant the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> he that writes a booke of iuſtification and explicates it in that large manner, doth write a booke of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in this ſenſe his aſſumption is falſe, for in the ſentence he alleaged againſt me. I limit the Doctrine of my booke to ſpeake concerning iuſtification by faith, that is, of iuſtification, ſo farre as it is by faith, and of faith ſo farre as it concernes iuſtification, which is to ſpeake of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as it depends vppon one cauſe, and of faith as it is one cauſe of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And ſo (I hope) I haue cleared it, to the iudgement of all indifferent and iudicious men, that I haue not deſerued to be accuſed of periury, lying, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now proceede to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing touching the laſt imputation obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt me in thoſe papers; which is acquiuocation, but this will neede no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
